# Analyzing-Public-Holiday-Impact-on-Consumer-Behavior
## Overview
This project aims to analyze the impact of public holidays on consumer behavior using transaction data from an e-commerce platform. The dataset includes information about sales, product purchases, returns, public holidays (such as Christmas, New Year, and Thanksgiving), and other related attributes. The objective is to understand how public holidays influence consumer spending, product returns, and purchasing patterns across different countries.

## Dataset Description
The dataset (holiday_sales_dataset.csv) contains 500,000 rows with the following fields:

Invoice: A unique identifier for each transaction.
StockCode: The product's stock code.
Description: A brief description of the product.
Quantity: The quantity of products purchased in the transaction.
InvoiceDate: The date of the transaction.
Price: The price of the product.
CustomerID: The ID of the customer.
Country: The country where the customer is located (USA, UK, Germany, France, Canada).
Holiday: A binary indicator for public holidays (1 for holiday, 0 for non-holiday).
Sales: The total sales amount (Quantity * Price). Negative values represent returns.
Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze how sales, returns, and customer behavior are affected by public holidays, such as:

Christmas
New Year's Day
Thanksgiving
Other public holidays
The project involves the following key steps:

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, outliers, and incorrect data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualize the distribution of sales and returns, analyze trends, and compare sales on public holidays vs non-holidays.
Hypothesis Testing: Perform statistical tests to determine if there are significant differences in consumer behavior on holidays vs regular days.
Insights Generation: Provide actionable insights for businesses based on the analysis.
Requirements
To run the analysis, you need the following Python packages:

pandas
numpy
matplotlib

Data Analysis
The data analysis includes the following steps:

Loading the Data:

Import the dataset using pandas.
Handle missing values and perform data cleaning.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize sales trends using line plots.
Compare sales on public holidays vs non-holidays using bar plots.
Analyze return rates and identify patterns during holidays.
Statistical Testing:

Perform hypothesis tests to compare mean sales on holidays vs regular days.
Calculate correlation between different variables (e.g., holiday vs sales, returns vs quantity).
Insights and Recommendations:

Identify holidays with significant sales spikes.
Determine customer return behavior during holidays.
Provide recommendations for businesses on how to optimize sales around public holidays.
